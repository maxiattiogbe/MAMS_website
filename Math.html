This class is taught by Mr. Regele. It covers a variety of topics from algebra, geometry, and precalculus. A lot of class time is devoted to discussing homework problems and Mr. Regele often selects students to present to the class. The emphasis is on the process rather than the right answer.

Mathematica is a software we learn to use at the beginning of the year. We have a year subscription through WPI that we paid for as part of the costs we paid at the beginning of the year after being admitted to MAMS.

For the assignment in the PDF file below, we had to fit different types of lines of best fit to data about the number of cancer deaths  in eight Oregon counties and the city of Portland versus an index of exposure that measures the proximity of the residents to the radiation contamination from the Atomic Energy Plant in Hanford, Washington. We had to show how we obtained the equation for each line and then compare how well the fit the data at the end.

<h2>HiMCM</h2>

<p>
On November 14-15, 2019 we participated in the 36 hour math modeling competition called HiMCM. Most groups for this were groups of four but there was one group of three. My group was a group of four with Ada, Advika, and Anika. Each year, two problems (Problem A and Problem B) are released for HiMCM and groups participating in the competition must choose one and write a paper on their solution. We used Mathematica to write our papers. Of the two problems released for 2019, my group chose Problem B. The objective of the problem was to measure the impact of a water bottle ban. We chose to break up the impact into environmental impact and monetary impact. We then thought about how we would express each and what are the most important variables that should be included. Then we made an equation for each and combined them to obtain an equation for total impact. Our paper is in the PDF file below.
