	I was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky on December 4, 2002. I have a younger brother named Nexi. 
	He was born on April 5, 2005 also in Bowling Green, Kentucky. My family consists of four people:
	my dad, my mom, my brother, and me. We spent a lot of quality time at home together, and we still 
	do today. We went to the park early in the morning and walked a lot every day. I remember seeing 
	rabbits and enjoying walking in the park very much. I went to preschool in Bowling Green for a year.

	Then, we moved to Milton, Massachusetts when I was between 4 and 5, and I attended kindergarten and 
	first grade at Tucker Elementary school in Milton. After that, we moved to Worcester, Massachusetts 
	and we still live here today. I attended grades 2 through 5 at Flagg Street School. I was invited to 
	Goddard Scholars Academy (GSA) at Sullivan Middle School. There I went through grades 6 through 8. 
	I participated in a Middlebury Interactive Languages immersive Spanish camp in Poultney, Vermont for
	four weeks in the summer during this time. It was the first time I spent that much time away from home, 
	but it was quite a valuable learning experience. I not only learned more Spanish, but also learned more
	about independence and self-sufficiency.

<p>	
	I continued GSA at South High Community School as a freshman and as a sophomore. The transition from 
	middle school to high school meant not only more work but more challenging work. In my sophomore year, 
	I took AP classes for the first time. I took AP Chemistry and AP Statistics. Finally, I applied to do my 
	junior and senior years of high school at Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science (MAMS) and was accepted
	 into the class of 2021. I am currently doing my junior year here.
