This class is taught by Mr. Ellis. We have covered the topics of kinematics, forces, energy, work, power, momentum, and impulse. We are currently covering rotational motion.

</p>
<p>
We do two über problems in the first two units (kinematics and forces). We do one for each unit. They are especially challenging problems that have many steps and have algebra and calculus versions. Everyone chooses to do either the algebra problem or the calculus problem. Then Mr. Ellis gives us different givens for our problems so everyone gets different answers even if they are both doing the algebra or calculus problem. After we get an answer we check with Mr. Ellis until we get it correct and them we write a paper on our solution. The PDF file below shows my solution to the calculus über problem from the forces unit.

Labs, and demos, are also an important component of this class so we can see the physics concepts we are learning about in action in real time. When we were learning about energy, we were randomly assigned groups and had to design a lab to analyze conservation of energy in a spring-based system. My group consisted of Bao Han, Hazelyn, and me. We suspended a rock from a series of rubber bands looped together. We varied the initial vertical stretch distance of the rubber bands and observed how it affected the maximum height of the rock. After the lab we had to make a template file from which we could prepare a poster if we had time to do so. The template is in the PDF file below.
