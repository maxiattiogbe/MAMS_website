  I like to play flute. I have played for school from 6th grade to 9th grade.
  I enjoy it very much because it is often relaxing. I still play occasionally when
  I have time to.  I took Martial Arts Lessons at Kenpo Academy (karate) from 2nd grade to 
  6th grade. I also participated in the Skyhawk Summer Sports Camps 
  (to play baseball, basketball, and soccer) in elementary school
   I also enjoy to playing tennis and swimming. I played tennis at
  Tenacity for several years in elementary school. More recently, I played on the 
  South High Community School tennis team last year in 10th grade. I started swimming
  lessons at Worcester Fitness in 2nd grade then eventually took swimming lessons at 
  the YWCA at 1 Salem Street. I finished the swimming lessons, and I still enjoy swimming
  today. In fact, I swim with my brother every Sunday. We used to swim at YWCA, but now
  we swim at the YMCA at 75 Shore Drive, Worcester, MA

My brother and I have also programmed an Arduino (C programming), done coding in the Python
programming language), and programmed a toy rover. We also have a solar robot kit that has 
a manual on how to make 14 configurations of parts for the solar robot.
