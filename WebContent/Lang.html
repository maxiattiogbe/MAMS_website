This class is taught by Ms. Wildfong, who also teaches Intermediate Spanish as well as Intermediate and Advanced French. Each class is an immersive experience in which the advanced classes must only speak in the target language in class all year long while the intermediate classes move toward being able to speak only in the target language in class. We must keep vocabulary journals in which we keep track of new vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and grammar we encounter in class. Vocabulary and grammar concepts are presented in context incorporated into fun activities, games, books, movies, and songs.  The class is very project based. For example, a major component of the class is a movie project in the target language. In B term we filled out storyboards. This term, C Term, we are filming. In D term, we will be editing. The goal of the class is to progress towards fluency in the target language. even if you have never taken a class in it.

When we covered the imperfect tense at the beginning of the year, we read a short story titled, "El día que terminó mi niñez" by Guillermo Cabrera Infante. The title means The Day That Ended My Childhood. After reading that text, we had to write a story from our own childhood in Spanish. I wrote about a time when I went to the park with my family. You can read it in the PDF below.

Every term we are given a text to record ourselves reading. We listen to the text being read at least three times before we start recording ourselves reading it. It is usually a news article. This recording is from A term.
