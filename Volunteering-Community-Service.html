<p>
This summer, I volunteered as part of the 
<a href="https://www.easterseals.com/ma/our-programs/recreation/adapted-swim-program.html">Easterseals 
Massachusetts Adaptive and Accessible Swim Program</a>. It has held at Bennett Field Pool on Friday
 mornings for six weeks from June 28th to August 2nd.  Each day the program, there were two
  sessions of about 45 minutes each. The first session was for kids ages 5-12,
  while the second was for children 13 years old or older and adults. I, along 
  with 3 to 4 other volunteers around my age, along with some adults helped the
   instructor set up and clean up after the program. Additionally, I, usually with
    another volunteer, was assigned to greet the participants as they came in and
     take attendance each week. Although the program is not meant to teach participants
      how to swim, most of them showed improvement on their abilities to safely move 
      through water.  I have been swimming for several years know, so I was glad to 
      use the skills I had attained to help teach others how to swim. I enjoy swimming; 
      this program has helped me spread that enjoyment to others. That made this a meaningful 
      experience for me.

I also have been volunteering for the
<a href="https://www.easterseals.com/ma/our-programs/recreation/accessible-martial-arts.html">Easterseals 
Massachusetts Accessible Martial Arts Program</a>. The goal of this program is to help people with disabilities
learn self defense techniques. I volunteer when it is held at the gym of the YWCA at 1 Salem Street,
Worcester MA. It is now also held at the Non-Profit Center at 89 South Street in Boston, Massachusetts.
 It is a lot of fun to help people with disabilities learn a variety of self-defense techniques such as different types
  of strikes and blocks. It is also a good source of exercise.
